## Building RSKAPI
To build the mockup with gcc test flags, run the following:
```
$ make debug
```

To build the mockup without gcc test flags, run either of the following:
```
$ make
$ make final
```

The program can be run with the following command after building:
```
$ make run
```

## API Tests
A few tests are included with the project. They can be built with:
```
$ make tests
```

The test programs can be run using:
```
$ make runtests
```
